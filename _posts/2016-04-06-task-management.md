# Task Management with Wunderlist

- Wunderlist tasks are very short shelf life
- Don\'t bother once completed
- They are meant to only handle the current and the prospective contexts of the work taken up in our office

- Wunderlist tasks are meant for
  - Prioritizing work -  this involves scheduling the urgency of the tasks as well as deferring the todos for the future
  - Managing daily standups - all the works mentioned in a daily standup should be a wunderlist task

- Assignment of wunderlist tasks signifies that the ownership of the task rests with the assignee. In our office, this assignment can be passed around depending on the evolving needs of the work and the urgency of the work involved and the availability of the assignee. However, in such cases - the current assignee and the new assignee should agree upon this change in assignment and the same be broadcasted to the entire office.

- Every wunderlist task should have a due date assigned. It is advisable to provide due dates, even if they are tentative for tasks that are being planned to be completed within the near and foreseeable future.
- Due dates of wunderlist tasks thus tentatively framed can and in fact should be regularly updated based on the evolving work situtaion of the assignee as this provides a rough outline of the work being planned for the next few days by the assignee.
- Tasks which have not been completed within the due date, should be updated with their status by a comment and then the due date updated.
